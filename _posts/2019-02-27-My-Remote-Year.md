When I boarded that flight to Mexico more than a year ago, I didn’t know what to expect. I certainly didn’t expect to fall in love with the country. But that’s what happened. I completely fell in love with the food, the people, the weather, the culture. I even loved speaking, or at last trying to speak in Spanish. But what I loved even more, was the freedom of flexibility of being able to work and travel at the same time.

So what initially begun as a quick one month “winter escape” eventually led to a complete lifestyle change. I went back to Montreal and sold or gave away most of my possessions. And then I headed back to Mexico with ___ and for another _ 2 months.  While there, I traveled and worked remotely in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico City, Oaxaca City, Puerto Escondido, Zipolite and Oaxaca,  San Cristoal de Las casa, Paleque, Merida, Playa Del Carmen, Cancun, Laguna Del Bacalar, Tulum and---

My experience there made me realize that I could make this “working remotely” thing my life as long as I had my laptop and cellphone and a good wifi connection or data. So I decided to continue on and I’ve worked remotely over the past ___ months in Colombia, Brazil, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and now Bali where I currently am. Cuba is the only country that I’ve been to that I didn’t do any work in due to internet restrictions.

It hasn’t always been smooth sailing and there have been some bumps along the way. But what I know for certain as that I am NOT going back to a 9 to 5 desk job. 

I also taught myself how to [code](http://williamruz.com/blog/why-i'm-teaching-myself-to-code/) and started taking on some freelance work in social media marketing.

And when Montreal experienced one of its [coldest](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/winter-weather-montreal-1.4466896) winters on record in Janaury this year, I knew I was ready. I booked a one-way ticket to Mexico City and armed with my laptop, suitcase and rusty 10 year old survival Spanish, I finally took the plunge.
