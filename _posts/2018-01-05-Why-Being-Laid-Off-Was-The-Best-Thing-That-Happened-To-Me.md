At the beginning of this year, I decided that I wanted to have more fun and freedom in 2018.

I usually avoid making new year’s resolutions like the plague, but a few years ago, as I started inching closer and closer to 30, I began looking back on my 20s and I didn’t like what I saw in the rearview mirror. I had sped through “my defining years” checking all the boxes that a responsible adult should. I had a university degree, a good career, a great circle of friends, and lived in an amazing condo in Toronto, but I was still feeling restless and unfulfilled.

To be honest, I was fed up with the office politics and the constant grind and repetitiveness of a 9 to 5 job. I did not want to spend the rest of my life stuck at a desk for 40 + hours a week with only 2 weeks of vacation every year. I wanted to live a more meaningful life filled with excitement and adventure instead of drowning in a sea of mediocrity and boredom.

So when I was laid off from my job in the summer of 2016, it felt like the universe had thrown me a life raft. That’s when I decided, "Fuck it. I'm going to live life on my own terms." And that involved working where I want, when I want and for who I want. I wanted to live a location independent lifestyle that would let me travel to amazing places, have amazing experiences and meet amazing people.

So that summer, I started laying the groundwork for the life I envisioned. I took on a part-time job that allowed me to work from home. The pay was peanuts, but I was happier than ever. Gone was the office politics, toxic colleagues and long unproductive meetings. Instead, I could work in bed all day, eat ice cream at 10 am, or just do simple things like schedule a dentist's appointment in the middle of the day without the guilt of having to sneak out of the office during my lunch break.
