At the beginning of this year, I decided that I wanted to have more fun and freedom in 2018.

I usually avoid making new year’s resolutions like the plague, but a few years ago, as I started inching closer and closer to 30, I began looking back on my 20s and I didn’t like what I saw in the rearview mirror. I had sped through “my defining years” checking all the boxes that a responsible adult should. I had a university degree, a good career, a great circle of friends, and lived in an amazing condo in Toronto, but I was still feeling restless and unfulfilled.
